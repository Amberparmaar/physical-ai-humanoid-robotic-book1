# Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

Welcome to the official blog of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project! This blog will serve as a companion to our AI-native textbook, providing updates on the latest developments in humanoid robotics, insights into our AI tutoring system, and practical tutorials on implementing the concepts covered in our textbook.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the next generation of artificial intelligence systems that directly interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital environments, Physical AI must navigate the complexities of physics, dynamics, and real-world uncertainty.

In this blog, we'll explore:

- The latest advances in humanoid robotics research
- How to implement ROS2 systems for complex robotic behaviors
- Best practices for simulation and real-world deployment
- Insights into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
- NVIDIA Isaac platform applications in humanoid robotics

## Our AI-Native Approach

Our textbook takes a revolutionary approach to robotics education by integrating AI-powered tutoring directly into the learning experience. Our RAG system provides real-time, context-aware responses to your questions, making learning robotics more accessible and personalized than ever before.

We'll share insights on how this technology enhances the learning experience and makes complex robotics concepts more accessible to students and professionals alike.

## Looking Ahead

In upcoming posts, we'll dive deeper into specific topics such as:

- Advanced manipulation techniques for humanoid robots
- Real-world applications of Physical AI
- Integration challenges between different robotic systems
- Safety considerations in humanoid robotics
- The future of human-robot interaction

Stay tuned for more insights and tutorials that will help you master the concepts of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
