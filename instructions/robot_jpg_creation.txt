Instructions for Creating Robot-Themed JPG Images:

To replace the current SVG images with colored JPG images of AI robots, follow these steps:

1. Create ai.jpg (200x200 pixels)
   - Create an image of a friendly robot with a focus on AI elements
   - Use your theme colors: #BBC863 (green) and #000000 (black)
   - Include visual elements that suggest intelligence or AI processing

2. Create favicon.jpg (16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels)
   - Create a small, iconic robot image
   - Keep it simple but recognizable at small sizes
   - Use high contrast colors for visibility in browser tabs

3. Create logo.jpg (200x200 pixels)
   - Design a robot-themed logo for your site
   - Ensure it's recognizable but detailed enough to be interesting
   - Consider how it will look as a site logo

4. Create robot.jpg (200x200 pixels)
   - Create a detailed image of an AI robot
   - Use your theme colors: #BBC863 (green) and #000000 (black)
   - Make it visually appealing for your robotics content

5. Create tech-stack.jpg (200x200 pixels)
   - Create a robot-themed image that represents technology stack
   - Show robot components or a robot in a tech environment
   - Use your theme colors throughout

After creating these images, place them in the static/img/ directory alongside the SVG files.

Then update your docusaurus.config.js file to reference the new JPG files where necessary.
