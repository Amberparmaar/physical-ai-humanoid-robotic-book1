Real Robot Images Implementation Guide

Current Status:
- You have robot-themed SVG images in the static/img directory
- The ai.svg file already contains a robot design as created earlier
- You have theme colors #BBC863 (green) and #000000 (black) applied throughout your site

To add real robot images (actual photographs or detailed digital art):

1. Download real robot images from:
   - Free stock photo sites: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay
   - Robot photography from robotics competitions
   - AI-generated robot images (using tools like DALL-E, Midjourney)
   - Custom robot illustrations

2. Recommended dimensions for your current setup:
   - logo.png: 200x200 pixels (or keep the current dimensions)
   - ai.svg: Convert to 200x200 JPG if you want to replace it
   - favicon.svg: 16x16 or 32x32 pixels (or convert to .ico format)
   - robot.svg: 200x200 pixels as JPG
   - tech-stack.svg: 200x200 pixels as JPG

3. How to add the images to static/img directory:
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to C:\Users\hp\Desktop\physical-ai-humanoid-robotics\static\img\
   - Copy and paste your downloaded robot images into this folder
   - Rename them appropriately (ai.jpg, favicon.jpg, logo.jpg, etc.)
   - Update docusaurus.config.js to reference the new file names

4. If you want to replace the SVG files with JPG versions:
   - Add the JPG files to the static/img directory
   - Update references in your config and any docs that reference these images
   - You can keep both SVG and JPG files if you want to switch back

5. For best results with your theme colors (#BBC863 and #000000):
   - Choose robot images with colors that complement your theme
   - Consider image editing to adjust colors slightly to match your palette
   - Use images with good contrast against your site's background

6. After adding images:
   - Test your site with 'npm run start' to ensure images display correctly
   - Verify all navigation elements still work with the new images
   - Check both light and dark themes display the images properly

Note: You already have robot-themed vector images (SVGs) which are clean and scalable. Real robot photos would add a different aesthetic to your site.
